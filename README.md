# IMDB-5000-movies
This is a database from IMDB with 5000 movies released up from 1916 to 2016 (a century) 
There are several questions we want to answer by looking into this database. Here is working guide: 

1. Load and check the DataFrame
2. Do simple statistics on the data
3. Find out NaN entries
4. Eliminate double entries

Once we have cleaned the data here are some questions we would like to answer: 

1. What is the most grossing movie? (that is the revenue surpased the budget by a big margin)
2. What is the lowest grossing movie?
3. Do highly rated movies perform better in terms of revenue?
4. Who is the most successful movie director?
5. Which genre brings in more money in the industry? (test this by the best 10 movies in each category)
6. Which is the worst performing genre in terms of revenue? (use the same top 10 movies of low earners)
